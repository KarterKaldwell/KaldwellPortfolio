    <p>I am a web design student living in Orlando, Florida.</p>

    <p>I have a dream of mastering Web Design as a craft, as an art form. Though I       am quite new to it, I already feel a passion and a calling to do something          impactful with it. My future plans for my Web Design journey are:</p>

      <li>Build a website that can act as a hub for mental health journaling and           help.</li>
      <li>Build a loyal clientele base that will allow me to pursue my dreams with         people I know and enjoy. </li>
      <li>Find remote work so that I can study the cultures of the world in person,         while still working a job I thoroughly enjoy!</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Below is my portfolio website. I hope to post just about every project I work on here, as well as my developer blog where I journal every step and milestone I take to get to a good place in the industry!
